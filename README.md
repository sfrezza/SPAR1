C Code from MS Thesis work in Automatic Schematics Generation (ASG)

This code presents a new approach to routing schematic diagrams. Probably the most valuable contribution
is the local and global routing heuristics that were implemented. Heuristic global and
local algorithms are presented which focus on congestion and crossover issues in the develop 
ment of aesthetically pleasing diagrams  Congestion is the basis for the global  and crossover
for the local router  This algorithm can work on a completed schematic but it is a work in progress
to apply them to schematics that are incrementally developed and/or interactive.
